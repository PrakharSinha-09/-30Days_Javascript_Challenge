## About the Challenge

The 30 Days JavaScript Challenge is a self-imposed challenge to improve my JavaScript skills by building a new project or solving a new problem every day for 30 days. The goal is to solidify my understanding of JavaScript concepts, improve problem-solving skills, and have fun while doing it!

## Getting Started

To get started with the projects in this repository, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine. Clone the repository and navigate to the day's challenge you want to work on.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/30-days-javascript-challenge.git
